when the code finally runs this how we generate  password

lets break down this code :

1:Import and Lists:
====================

import random: This line imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers and selections.

Three lists are created to store characters for different password components:
----> letters: Contains all uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z, A-Z).
----> numbers: Contains digits (0-9).
----> symbols: Contains special characters (!, #, $, etc.).

2:Welcome Message and User Input:
=================================

Prints a welcome message to the user.
User input sections prompt the user to specify the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers in the password:

nr_letters = int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n")): Reads the user's input for the number of letters, converts it to an integer (int()), and stores it in the nr_letters variable.

Similarly, nr_symbols and nr_numbers are obtained for symbols and numbers.

3.Secure Password Generation:
==============================

password_list = []: An empty list named password_list is created to store the password characters.

A loop iterates for the specified number of letters (nr_letters): (for the total no of letters user want  password to be)

Inside the loop, random.choice(letters) selects a random letter from the letters list and appends it to the             password_list.

Similar loops are used to append random symbols (nr_symbols times) and numbers (nr_numbers times) to the password_list.

random.shuffle(password_list) shuffles the elements in password_list to create a random order of characters, this makes the password more secure 


Generating the Final Password:

An empty string variable password is initialized.
A loop iterates through the shuffled password_list:
Inside the loop, each character from password_list is added to the password string, building the final password.
print(f"Your password is: {password}") displays the generated password to the user.
