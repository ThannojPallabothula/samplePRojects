Overview
---------

The Voice Translator project is designed to translate spoken English input into your desired language as  text and audio output using Python libraries. 
It leverages the Google Translate API for translation and SpeechRecognition for speech-to-text conversion.The translated text is then converted into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech
(gTTS) library, and the resulting audio is played using the Playsound library.

Why Voice Translator?
---------------------
Voice Translator can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

Language Learning: It allows users to practice speaking in a foreign language and receive immediate feedback in their native language.
Communication: It facilitates real-time translation during conversations between individuals who speak different languages.
Accessibility: It aids individuals with hearing impairments by converting spoken language into text and vice versa.

How It Works?
----------------
The Voice Translator project consists of the following steps:

Speech Input: The program prompts the user to speak and listens for input using the microphone.
Speech Recognition: The speech input is transcribed into text using the SpeechRecognition library. The recognized text is then printed to the console.
Translation: The recognized text is translated from English to French using the Google Translate API provided by the googletrans library.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: The translated text is converted into speech in the target language (French) using the gTTS library.
Audio Output: The generated audio file is saved as "hello.mp3" and played using the Playsound library, allowing the user to hear the translated text.


Setup and Dependencies
------------------------
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

---->googletrans
---->SpeechRecognition (install with pip install SpeechRecognition)
---->gtts (Google Text-to-Speech, install with pip install gtts)
---->playsound (install with pip install playsound)
Usage
Run the Python script voiceTranslator.py.
When prompted, speak in English.
Wait for the program to process and translate your speech.
The translated text will be printed to the console, and you will hear the translated audio output.


Notes:
--------
Ensure that your microphone is properly connected and configured.
Internet connection is required for using the Google Translate API.
Depending on the length of the input and network speed, translation and audio generation may take some time.
